- QueryPackage exposes MEF exports of query handlers

- DecoratorChainBuilder simplifies the creation of a decorator chain. Maybe this can be solved with MEF DI, but it's to cumbersome to me (this can be solved easily with DI frameworks like SimpleInjector).

- QueryProcessor tries to exports handler for given query (taken from https://cuttingedge.it/blogs/steven/pivot/entry.php?id=92)
